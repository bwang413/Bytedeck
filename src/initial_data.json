It has survived not \r\nonly five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, \r\nremaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with \r\nthe release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more\r\n recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker \r\nincluding versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br></p></p>",

The point of \r\nusing Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of \r\nletters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it \r\nlook like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web \r\npage editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a \r\nsearch for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their \r\ninfancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by \r\naccident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br></p></p>",
